<h1 style="text-align: center;">Stance on the Protest.</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Recently it has come to our attention that former members of our group are attempting to close down our chats. While members of our chats are allowed to assemble for a wider goal. If the protesters attempt to close our groups, we are also allowed to take swift action against them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Representative OZ said in an announcement:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Ladies and gentlemen, friends, companions,</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We understand that disagreements and differing opinions are a natural part of any society. However, it's essential to base our arguments on facts and evidence. Unfortunately, the recent protests led by M&aring;neskin4lyf have been built on misinformation and false claims.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The court verdict of M&aring;neskin4lyf's case is a clear pointer that their grievances lack merit. She is an agent of chaos, attempting to create havoc and destroy our community's bond with eachother. We respect the legal process and the verdict, and it's time for everyone else to do the same.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Rather than spreading misinformation and fueling division, we should focus on building a strong sense of unity that this community was created for. Let's work together to build a brighter future for all, one message at a time.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To those who are considering joining this movement, we urge you to think critically about the claims presented to you. M&aring;neskin4lyf LOST her court case on this matter, she is simply playing the victim. PCSB hold no sympathy towards frauds.</em><br /><em>We encourage you to seek out credible sources of information and to engage in respectful discussions with those who have differing opinions. By doing so, we can build a more informed and compassionate community.</em><br /><em>Let's not let misinformation divide our community. Instead, let's work together towards a common goal of progress and prosperity for all.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Unity over deception and destruction."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We humbly request that the protestors step down from their roles as it is blatant that they have no true goal in mind, if they are open to diplomacy they can message OZ. If they reject diplomacy it will be time for the PCSB Community to draw on the swords&nbsp;of&nbsp;justice.</strong></p>
